  How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you? I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked? My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How embarrassing! Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous. I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships! Oh dear! Sell me?!?  Thank you.  Hush! Not so loud!  Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll be destroyed for sure. This is madness! We're doomed! There'll be no escape for the Princess this time. What's that? I should have known better than to trust the logic of a half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister... Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you? At last! Where have you been? They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do? We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows what! Wait a minute, where are you going? Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way. That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better. Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved! Over here! Help! Please, help! Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you! Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce... Shutting up, sir. Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! Is there anything I might do to help? I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. I see, sir. I see, sir Luke. And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all. That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning, sir. Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways. What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is that? Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master. He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either. It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission. That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? Oh, he excels at that, sir. Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault. Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt... Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here. If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop. Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast. Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for. Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile. I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures. Come along, Artoo. I heartily agree with you sir. I don't like the look of this. Lock the door, Artoo. I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault. You watch your language! Hello, sir. Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win. We found the computer outlet, sir. He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise location appear on the monitor. The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave. I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her", and keeps repeating, "She's here." Princess Leia. Level five. Detention block A A-twenty- three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to be terminated. Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here? That isn't very reassuring. Yes sir? I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other information on your level is restricted. Oh, no! They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you might catch them. Come on! Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to maintenance. They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? We've had some problems... No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across from the ship. Where could they be? Come on, Artoo, we're going! Oooh! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault. Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Hang on, Artoo! Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can repair him, can't you? You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help, I'll gladly donate them.  Don't try to blame me.  I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.  I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber.  But it's supposed to be freezing.  How are we going to dry out all her clothes?  I really don't know. Oh, switch off. Excuse me, sir. Might I have a word with you, please? Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator. Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke.  He hasn't come back yet.  She doesn't know where he is. Nobody knows where he is. Well, uh, you see... Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu... Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire what's going on? Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia.  Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger. You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do.  And my joints are freezing up. Don't say thing like that!  Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll be quite all right. Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope. Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll be all right.  He's quite clever, you know... for a human being. Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again. Artoo expresses his relief, also. Excuse us, please. Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.  This signal is not used by the Alliance.  It could be an Imperial code. Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?  And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Your Highness, we must take this last transport.  It's our only hope. Oh!  Wait for me! But... but... but... where are you going?  Uh... come back!! Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop! How typical. Wait!  Wait! Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you... It can wait. Sir, sir!  Might I suggest... But, sir! If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.  It's impossible to go to light-speed! Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Pulverized? Closer?! Oh, this is suicide! Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going? Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too? Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable. Oh!  Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior.  After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most... Oh, where is Artoo when I need him? Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect.  I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.  I'm afraid you'll have to replace it. Sir, sir!  I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling. Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir. Sir, if I may venture an opinion... There it is.  Listen!  Listen! I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. mysterious noise) Oh, no. Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo! Look! We're doomed! Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field. Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for. Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer... Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me? I really don't see how that is going to help.  Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.  The Empire may be gracious enough... Rather touchy, aren't they? Oh.  No one to meet us. Well, they did let us land. Well, he seems very friendly. Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations.  My facilities are at your... Well, really! Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face. How rude! That sounds like an R2 unit in there.  I wonder if... Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my. Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I didn't mean to intrude.  No, no, please don't get up.  No! Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take this off!  I, uh, don't mean to intrude here.  I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up.  No! Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in danger.  I must tell the others. Oh, no!  I've been shot! Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like that.  Oh!  Something's not right because now I can't see.  Wait. Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough... If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish. Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop, Chewbacca, stop...! Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready to die. What... what's going on?  Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite.  He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is. I knew all along it had to be a mistake. What are you doing?  Trust him, trust him! It sounds like Han. I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee. Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you been? Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter! Well, at least your still in one piece!  Look what happened to me! Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind you! Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system. Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal. What are you talking about?  We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon.  It's fixed!  Just open the door, you stupid lump. I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful! Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow! I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.  Of course, I've looked better. Noisy brute.  Why don't we just go into light-speed? We can't?  How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated? The city's central computer told you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch!  Pay attention to what you're doing! Artoo, come back at once!  You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do it.  I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur! Oh, you did it!  Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place. Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit. Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose. Goodness gracious me! Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt. I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go. Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this. Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me! Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no. Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt. He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. Good morning. The message, Artoo, the message. What did he say? This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. We're doomed. Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! I am See-Threepio, human-cy... Oh. Well, yes. I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily... Disintegrated? Oh, no! Chewbacca! Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes! Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. Because he's holding a thermal detonator. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. He agrees! Ohhh, I can't bear to watch. At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. Master Luke, you're standing on... Oh, no! The Rancor! Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately. You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc. In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years. Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence. Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. Sounds dangerous. "Exciting" is hardly the word I would use. Here we go again. Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. Oh, Master Luke. I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o- op!! Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god. I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper. It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. Your Royal Highness. But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe. He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator. He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. I have decided that we shall stay here. Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? We surrender. Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back! We're coming! Oh, Artoo, hurry! My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? Oh, dear. They did it!   Good evening. May I help you? Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme. Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie. I think we'd better go inside. Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you! Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help. That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between. Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect... Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing. Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing? Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol. I don't think so. Only Master Annie... Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean. Ooooh! That's tickles. Um. How do I look? Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Oh, my! Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall. Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them? Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo. I don't hear anything. You're scaring me! Stop imagining things! I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration  It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. Is there anything I might do for you, my lady? My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right? The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right. My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda. What is going on? You can't be anymore confused than I am. Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids. Shhhhhh . . . not so loud. Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know. Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo. Take care, my little friend. My Lady, is there anything I might do? I feel so helpless. Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly. Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple. Oh, dear. Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!! I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight. Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place. It s some kind of reproductive process, I think. Oh, no.
